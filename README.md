# StarshipInspector3

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION :(

I am attempting to implement Login using Microsoft Identity, combining code samples from my classwork and the textbook.  I should've guessed, the textbook method is more complex and relies on previous chapters that I've skipped over.  As of this writing the page doesn't quite work, and I'm deep into a debugging phase.

I would invite onlookers to judge this fairly and at any time.  Meanwhile I will continue to improve this work until I see said judgement.

Starship DTO object is now on the server, so I edited the frontend.  Now there is evidence of meaningful interaction between the 5 tables (starships, hulls, reactors, thrusters, weapons).

Next steps (resuming work on Monday afternoon):
- deploy to Azure
- User login page
- tidy up
